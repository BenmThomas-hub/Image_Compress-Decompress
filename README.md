Reid Morin and Ben Thomas

We have correctly implemented our compression and decompression algorithm algorithm and everything that entails including our bitpacking, Array2 function modifications, and all of the correct computations for all coefficients that are packed into bits. 

The main file takes in the given commands by the user and chooses to either compress or decompress the file depending on the userâ€™s inputs. The file given is then taken into either file to read and copy the data to a vector where in the compress function, trims the image to a fit width and height and within both the compress and decompress, their respective functions are then called to carry out the needed operations to compress or decompress the file. These functions and operations are found within the compute.rs file and the bitpack.rs file and are called in accordance with the intended transformation and in the order they need to occur.
